My name is Prateek Sharma. I have completed my Btech Comp Science from NIIT University. It looks Like you have stumbled upon my GitHub profile. Currently, I am Working as a Software Engineer 1 at Practo. I develop and test scalable and robust backend solutions for the healthcare platform. I use Python, Flask, Docker, MySQL, Redis, and AWS to build and deploy microservices, APIs, and databases. I also collaborate with other engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver high-quality features and user experiences.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from NIIT University in 2022, where I developed a keen interest in problem-solving and backend development. I participated in several hackathons and coding competitions and won the IBM Hack Challenge 2020 Jury's Award and the Google DSC-WOW hackathon category prize.
